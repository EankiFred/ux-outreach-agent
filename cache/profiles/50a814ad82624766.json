For this reason, we support institutions that care for children, the sick and the needy. In addition, we make our contribution towards CO 2 neutrality and waste avoidance. At LINEAR, we actively take responsibility for a healthy world in order to pass on a planet worth living on to future generations. In doing so, we want to create value - for our customers, our employees and the entire company. Our product contributes to a sustainable construction industry, but we as a company also act sustainably and responsibly. Sustainability is a fundamental cornerstone of our corporate values. We are climate neutral by minimizing our C0 2 footprint as well as actively avoiding waste. We stand up for sustainable action internally and externally and set a good example. Let us inspire you with our work. Engineers Without Borders Germany Ingenieure ohne Grenzen e.V. is a non-profit and independent development cooperation organization. It supports people where technical cooperation is necessary and possible, especially by providing basic infrastructural needs in the areas of water, electricity and sanitation. In joint projects with local partners at schools and in rural communities, practical and professional solutions in the areas of water, electricity and sanitation are developed and implemented. Regional materials are used wherever possible and solutions are adapted to local conditions. The projects are only successfully completed when local people are able to continue them on their own - according to the principle of helping people to help themselves. In Germany, bridges are built between cultures: Technical language courses are held for people with refugee experiences and a migration background, the knowledge acquired is applied together in technical workshops, and ways are sought to enable them to enter the German labor market. The charitable work of the German branch of \"Engineers Without Borders\", Ingenieure ohne Grenzen e.V., impresses LINEAR time and again. Recently, we were very happy to donate 5% of the software sales rounded up to 70 000 € in a special campaign and thus support the great work of the many volunteers again. A big thank you also to our customers, who made this contribution possible with their decision for LINEAR. everwave We support everwave and declare war on the waste in our waters. Every year, more than 11 million tons of plastic end up in the oceans. This not only has a devastating impact on life underwater, but also on the entire environment, the economy and ultimately on all of us. The trash mainly makes its way from land to sea through rivers, and that's where the Aachen-based startup comes in. The company is developing special trash collection boats that collect the trash floating in rivers and take it away for recycling. We were particularly impressed by the holistic approach involving local schools, universities and politics. Everwave also offers companies the opportunity to offset their waste footprint, the amount of waste produced by one or more products, or a free sum. For every amount a company pays, everwave collects a certain share of waste from waters around the world. This is then returned to the cycle as locally as possible, depending on the mission and infrastructure. LINEAR has also used the Plastic Credits to offset its plastic footprint and has been \"on board\" as a supporter of everwave since 2022. Donation project Malawi As part of the LINEAR fundraising campaign 2021, the construction of an elementary school in the Southern Region of Malawi was successfully implemented with the help of \"Bücherbörse Köln e.V.\" and the \"abc Gesellschaft\". The country is one of the poorest in the world and many children have no access to education as a result. This has enabled at least 400 children to receive a school education who would otherwise never have the opportunity. We in the rich industrialized countries are also becoming very aware of how important education and classroom instruction are. Thanks to an additional donation from the LINEAR staff, it was also possible to build a well to enable a mango plantation in the immediate vicinity of the school. We are very proud of the positive response and support that the project has brought. Learn more Planted In spring 2024, we reported on our cooperation with the Cologne-based company Planted, which was launched in 2023. As a reminder, Planted's vision is to inspire people to protect the climate in a positive way. Their “all-in-one sustainability platform” has already enabled us to determine our company's internal carbon footprint, identify internal carbon hotspots and jointly develop reduction options. But there's more: last Monday (09.12.2024) we planted our own company forest in the Hürtgenwald! Under the expert guidance of the Rureifel-Jülicher Börde regional forestry office, we planted copper beeches and silver firs. The young trees were selected in advance on the basis of the site conditions so that they can thrive in the long term and create sustainable added value. Our company forest will now not only contribute to climate protection, but also strengthen local biodiversity! A huge thank you to: Planted for the coordination and organization! the team from the forestry office for their expert support, the opportunity to ask questions and gain exciting insights into sustainable reforestation! our LINEAR team, who braved the wet and cool weather to plant our company forest! If you would like to visit our company forest digitally, you will soon be able to do so from the comfort of your office chair! A digital twin of the forest will soon be integrated on our website, showing exactly where the trees are located. All further details and information about Planted, the cooperation and how it came about can be found in the corresponding blog post: To the blog post Fightback against poverty Fightback against Poverty is a nonprofit humanitarian organization dedicated to providing rapid assistance to children and families in the greatest need, whether due to disease, hunger, poverty, war, disaster or exploitation. When government agencies are too slow or fail to provide support, they are there to help. Fightback against Poverty was founded in 2017 by Avdo Iljazovic and Andreas Schindler and has already been able to launch aid projects in several European and African countries to help people in recent years. It all started when Avdo Iljazovic donated all his earnings as a football player at SV Rott in Aachen to charitable causes. In the meantime, other soccer players such as Marc-Andre Ter Stegen are also among the supporters. Through donations, charity events and partnerships, Fightback against Poverty is able to be there for people on the ground and help them. We are excited about the further development and are happy to be able to make a contribution. Learn more UNICEF UNICEF is the United Nations (UN) Children's Fund and is active in over 190 countries worldwide. Wars, disasters, diseases, exploitation or lack of participation: From rapid emergency relief to long-term reconstruction, UNICEF helps girls and boys all over the world grow up healthy and safe and develop their full potential. Sudan is experiencing one of the worst humanitarian crises in the world. We donate to help children and their families with clean water, food and medical care. We also support UNICEF projects in Lebanon. The focus here is on education and psychosocial support to offer children and families new prospects in the midst of crises. Learn more Doctors without borders Worldwide, independent, fast and close to the people: Doctors without Borders provide medical aid in conflict areas, after natural disasters and during epidemics for millions of people who would otherwise have been left alone and could die from their illnesses or injuries. With our donation, we are currently supporting Doctors Without Borders in its work in Chad. The organization provides humanitarian aid in a country marked by conflict and extreme poverty. The people in Gaza are also dependent on medical aid. With our donation, we are helping to ensure that Médecins Sans Frontières can continue to care for the injured and support medical facilities in an extremely difficult situation. Learn more Aachener Tafel Aachener Tafel e.V. is celebrating its 25th anniversary as an important social institution in the region. For a quarter of a century, the Aachener Tafel has been committed to supporting people in need. Christmas is a time of joy and togetherness. With our donation to the Tafel, we are supporting the “Christmas box” campaign. This sum enables the distribution of food and small gifts to needy families to bring them joy at Christmas. breakfast4kids One in four children does not have a packed lunch in his or her school bag. The non-profit organization breakfast4kids is therefore committed to ensuring that all children receive a breakfast. Every morning, the helping bakeries prepare hundreds of sandwiches and deliver them to schools in the Aachen region. breakfast4kids thus guarantees children a fresh breakfast on every school day for a year, so that they can be healthier, concentrate more and perform better. We are more than happy to support this great work in our local community! Aktion Deutschland hilft – Emergency Aid Ukraine The war in Ukraine has left countless people in need. We are supporting \"Aktion Deutschland Hilft\". This will enable aid projects to be implemented for those affected by the war and refugees in neighboring countries. SOS Kinderdorf - Help for Ukraine The Ukraine war is hitting people with unrelenting force. According to estimates, 17.7 million of the total 40 million Ukrainians are in need. Many children and adults are also suffering from the psychological consequences of violence, flight and worries about their future. \"SOS Kinderdörfer\" employees stand by children and families in Ukraine and neighboring countries. Dorfverein Schnepfenthal We support the village association \"Dorfverein Schnepfenthal in the implementation of local community projects and cultural events. The aim of the young association is to bring old and young together, to preserve the village, its nature and its history and, of course, to celebrate great festivals together!
