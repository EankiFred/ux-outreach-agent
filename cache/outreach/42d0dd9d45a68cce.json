    "draft_v1": "Figma’s multiple seat types (Collab, Dev, Full) and tiered AI‑credit model create recurring, quantifiable decisions for org admins — yet it’s unclear which admin APIs expose seat and credit usage. I propose a low‑risk, 2–4 week decision‑support prototype for Org Admins: an explainable recommender that ingests team usage (seats, feature adoption, AI‑credit burn) and outputs prioritized actions (seat reallocations, plan changes, AI‑credit purchases) with cost and 6–12 week impact forecasts. We’d build it as an offline prototype using exports or sandboxed data and deliver an interactive report plus click‑through admin UI. Can we do a 15‑minute sanity‑check call to confirm data access and KPIs?",
    "draft_v2": "Your Dev Mode/MCP features and the platform’s design‑system controls suggest two practical decision levers: developer seat allocation and library governance — yet I don’t know if per‑team usage and AI‑credit metrics are available via APIs. My suggested low‑risk prototype (2–4 weeks) builds a small decision agent for Design Ops: it analyzes exported usage, simulates 2–3 scenarios (seat mix, plan upgrade, credit top‑up), and produces ranked recommendations with estimated costs and expected time‑to‑value. Deliverables: interactive scenario tool plus brief playbook for Ops. Interested in a 15‑minute call to verify data availability and agree success metrics?",
