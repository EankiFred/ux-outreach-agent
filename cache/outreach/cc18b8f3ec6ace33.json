    "draft_v1": "I noticed SEBA supplies hydrometric devices that measure water level, quality and flow for water authorities, disaster relief and meteorological services — and that you offer software/downloads, which suggests structured telemetry and service records may exist. If so, a low‑risk 2–4 week prototype can deliver an agentic decision‑support tool to prioritise maintenance and service visits for field stations. Inputs: sensor status/alarms, service history, weather/high‑water alerts and a simple failure‑risk score. Output: a ranked action list (immediate, within 48 h, schedule) with a short rationale for each recommendation. Can we do a 15-minute call to sanity‑check feasibility and data access?",
    "draft_v2": "SEBA’s mix of devices and service offerings implies recurring operational decisions — e.g., which stations to service after alarms or ahead of storm events. A contained 2–4 week prototype could produce a ranked maintenance plan using sensor telemetry, past service logs and weather warnings, returning clear, explainable recommendations (immediate / 48 h / plan). The approach is low risk: work from anonymised CSVs or sample exports to avoid early integrations and validate value quickly. Before starting I’d confirm data availability and an internal sponsor. Would you have 15 minutes for a quick feasibility check this week?",

      "Reference to SEBA’s core measurements: water level, water quality and flow",
