Given that, a low‑risk way to test decision support is a 2–3 week operational prioritization prototype. We’d ingest a small set of existing inputs (backlog, usage metrics, incident logs) in read‑only mode, run simple trade‑off models, and deliver a lightweight UI plus an exportable prioritized list with estimated impact and confidence bands. No production changes required; handoff includes docs and a runbook. If that approach sounds useful, a 15‑minute sanity check call is enough to confirm scope and sample data.",
    "draft_v2": "The brief doesn’t include Linear’s core product or target users, so I’ll keep this light. A 2‑week roadmap tradeoff simulator is a low‑risk way to validate decision support: we’d ingest a handful of backlog items and basic usage/cost signals (read‑only), run scenario simulations, and deliver an interactive spreadsheet and one‑page memo showing prioritized features with simple sensitivity analysis. No changes to production systems; deliverables include step‑by‑step rerun instructions. If this aligns with your needs, can we do a 15‑minute sanity check call to confirm available data and the right stakeholders?",
