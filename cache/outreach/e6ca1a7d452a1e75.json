    "draft_v1": "I noticed Notion already combines Docs, Project Management, Calendar and AI Meeting Notes, and that “Custom Agents” are announced but timing is unclear. That makes a short, low‑risk prototype practical: a 2–4 week Meeting→Decision assistant that aggregates AI Meeting Notes, relevant Notion pages and Calendar/Inbox context, then surfaces 2–4 prioritized decision options with recommended owners, next steps and a simple confidence score. Build as a read‑only template/panel using existing Notion AI, Search and API — no new infra or production agents required. If this sounds useful, can we do a 15‑minute sanity check to align scope and pilot stakeholders?",

I suggest a 2–4 week Meeting→Decision prototype: pull meeting notes, linked project pages and calendar context, synthesize recommended options, assign owners and surface a brief rationale and confidence indicator. Deliver as an interactive template or sidebar using current Notion AI/Search and the API to keep risk low and data inside your workspace. It’s designed for a small cross‑functional pilot (Product/Ops). Can we book 15 minutes this week for a sanity check on scope and success criteria?",
