But much of that magic has been lost over time, replaced by subpar tools and practices that slow teams down and hold back great work. Frustrated with the status quo, we decided to build something better. Something that teams would actually enjoy using. We named it Linear to signify progress. What started as a simple issue tracker, has since evolved into a powerful project and issue tracking system that streamlines workflows across the entire product development process. We don't think of Linear as just a better \"tool\", but as a better \"way\" to build software. Today, thousands of teams around the globe — from early-stage startups to public companies — use Linear to build their products. Linear helps them to focus on what they do best: Crafting software experiences that feel magical again. We care deeply about the quality of our work Linear has always been a fully remote company. Today, our small but mighty team is distributed across North America and Europe. What unites us is relentless focus, fast execution, and our passion for software craftsmanship. We are all makers at heart and care deeply about the quality of our work, down to the smallest detail.

A craftsmanship that yields products of an exceptional, almost magical, quality. It’s difficult to describe this quality with words and impossible to measure it in numbers, but you can feel it when it’s there. You know it when you experience it. To bring back this level of quality, we are building a tool that empowers product teams to do their best work. A tool with unparalleled speed, focus, and design. Building this tool requires a team of talented individuals who care deeply about the quality of their work, no matter if it’s engineering, design, or customer support. We are looking for people who share our passion for software craftsmanship and getting even the smallest details right. If that sounds like you, please reach out and join us on our quest. ›_ README Karri Saarinen A conversation on quality Tuomas Artman Building the sync engine Lenny’s Podcast How we build products Indie At home with Karri Saarinen The Pragmatic Engineer Move fast with little process How we think and work Linear's mission is to inspire and accelerate builders. To turn that ambition into reality, we operate based on a set of core principles that keep us focused. 01 Ship early Simplify and ship smaller. 02 Build with users Listen carefully and understand their problems. 03 Know what good looks like Find and create good things. Point out what needs to change to make it better. 04 Think in principles Not in playbooks. 05 Build things that last Put care into the foundation. Don't make it a future person's problem. 06 Avoid side quests Don't fix every problem. Avoid adding unnecessary process or documents. 07 Say it as it is Get to the point and assume good intentions. 08 Keep the team small, do more with less We build better with fewer people. Wear multiple hats. 09 Hire the best people The best people hire the best people. Help recruit. 10 Create fans Build a community of people who use, love, and defend the product. Fully remote The freedom to work remotely allows for more meaningful work.
