Our vision is to make design accessible to all because we know that nothing great is made alone. We’re a team of makers who celebrate our differences and share a passion for our community. We’re hiring across our global hubs and remotely in the US and Canada. Come join us! See open positions Our Values and Culture Our values and culture are the underpinning for all that we do at Figma—we believe that a great product is inextricably linked to a great internal community. Build community We’re multiplayer people who love the weird, wonderful magic that happens when people connect. We build bridges—with both our Figmates and our users. Run with it Building Figma is about taking initiative, being bold and charting a new course, not running a playbook. Figmates are building the future of design by tackling big, scary, exciting challenges like Figma’s future depends on it. Because it does. Love your craft We build for builders and try to make complex things feel simple. We ask why until we get to the core and continually focus on solving the right problem, not just shipping work. Grow as you go With humility and curiosity, we give and get the direct feedback we all need to become great. Everyone’s a work in progress, and we’re here to help each other grow. Play Playing is learning. We embrace spontaneous, unstructured exploration—because that’s where we find our best ideas. Life at Figma Connection and kindness are core to our culture (after all, we’re a group of people building a collaboration tool). We focus on lifting each other up instead of competing amongst ourselves, and we build relationships through numerous company traditions. Figmate Community Groups Our Figmate Communities are an essential part of our value of \"Build Community.\" These groups are comprised of Figmates interested in developing community, social awareness, and education regarding groups with shared characteristics or life experiences, and are open to all Figmates regardless of whether or not they are part of that group or share those characteristics or life experiences themselves. Maker Week A time set aside once a year to pursue wild, silly, and imaginative ideas. The whole company takes part, and people can work on anything Figma-related that piques their curiosity.
