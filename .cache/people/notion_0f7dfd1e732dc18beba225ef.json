If you’re reading this, you’re probably like me—spending most of your days in your office, in front of a computer. You probably have fifteen tabs open: one for email, one for Slack, one for Google Docs, and on, and on… But have you ever thought about where these “work tools” came from? Or why there are so many of them? To answer these questions, and to explain why we created Notion, we have to travel back in time. As people flooded to factories during the Industrial Revolution, many tools were invented to ease the management overload. Typewriters replaced illegible handwriting. File cabinets stored more information than any clerk could remember (and also won the gold medal at the 1893 Chicago World’s Fair!) Tools like these paved the way for offices as we know them today. Fast forward to the 1950s, when computers came into the workplace. At first, they were lifeless, room-sized monsters that operated on paper and punch cards. They were used solely for number-crunching. Then something magical happened in the 1970s! A generation of pioneers saw the computer as something far beyond a number-crunching machine. They dreamt a future where computers could amplify imagination (Alan Kay), augment intellect (Doug Engelbart), and expand our thoughts far beyond text on paper (Ted Nelson). A tool unlike anything we have seen before. Play Uh-oh! It looks like your ad blocker is preventing the video from playing. Please watch it on YouTube But things didn’t turn out that way. As the legend goes, when Steve Jobs “borrowed” the ideas behind personal computing from Xerox PARC, many subtle, but crucial, differences were lost. Hit play and listen to the man himself. And that’s where we are today. Google Docs made typewriters multiplayer. Dropbox brought file cabinets to the cloud. But conceptually, they evolved little beyond their Industrial Revolution ancestors. We duct-tape everything together with emails, copy/paste, and countless open tabs. That’s where Notion comes in. We want to break away from today’s tools—and bring back some of the ideas of those early pioneers. As a first step, we are blending much of your workflow into an all-in-one workspace . Want a task list? A product roadmap? A design repository? They are now all in one place. You can even customize your own workspace from dozens of building blocks. Solve your problems your way, bounded only by your imagination. Hopefully you’ve gotten a good sense of why we started Notion. Challenging the status quo is not an easy task. Check out the product! Write in! We need early adopters like you to start a movement. See you soon! “ The best way to predict the future is to invent it. ” Alan Kay, computing pioneer Join us Notion is based in beautiful downtown San Francisco, with offices around the world.

Our mission is to make that a ubiquitous reality. Browse full-time openings Play Uh-oh! It looks like your ad blocker is preventing the video from playing. Our story Early computing pioneers envisioned a future where machines on our desks could amplify our imagination, extend our intellect, and help us model information in ways never before seen. This is the type of tool we want to build together at Notion — one that gives you the software you can mold and shape like clay to solve your problems your way. We’ve heard Notion described many ways. It can be as simple as a blank piece of paper, making writing feel light and delightful. It can be as complex as a relational database that stores huge amounts of data. We sometimes compare it to a set of Legos (if Legos were designed by The New York Times). But at its core, Notion is a toolbox of software building blocks that let you manage your life and work however you find most useful. To make this possible, we’ve brought together a diverse team of individuals passionate about computing, history, art, alternative programming languages, music, skateboarding, and craft.

And people do their best work when they feel like they belong — included, valued, and equal. This is the Notion we want to build, where everyone brings their full selves to work knowing that they’ll be heard, championed, and supported to succeed. We hope you’ll join us. ☕ Office culture Notion is an in-person company, and currently requires its employees to come to the office for two Anchor Days (Mondays & Thursdays) and requests that employees spend the majority of the week in the office (including a third day). Being an in-office-focused company enables us to capitalize on the energy that comes from us being in the same place. This is a great opportunity to build relationships, work with your teammates, and collaborate on projects. Teams have started adding a third in-office day for team-based work for things such as group maker time, brainstorm sessions, team bonding, and more! This way, Notinos spend the majority of the week in the office. Life at Notion When it comes to our culture, we’d rather show than tell.
